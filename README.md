# Welcome to CashFlowMinimizer DSA project which includes Major Data Structures like Graphs, Maps etc.. It's Objective is to reduce the number of Transactions in between banks with same type of transaction it has.

1. Initial phase is to create a Bank Class with attributes as "bank name", "Net amt" and "types of payment modes".
2. Coming to Second Phase We have started in writing the main() function Because it is the starting point for any Java application.
3. In main Function At first I have created an Object for Scanner class for manual Input.
4. Next I have Taken an input for the Number of banks that are participating in the transactions.
5. Next I have created an Array of Banks class with an argument as Number of Banks.
6. Next I have created a Map Object which is helpful for storing the "Bank Name and The number of payment modes it Contains".
